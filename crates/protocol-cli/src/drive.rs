//! `protocol drive` — walking a workflow by asking the engine, and doing only what the answers
//! permit.
//!
//! The third module split of `main.rs`, on the criterion the first two set: a verb family with its
//! own store — here, its own *run directory* — its own vocabulary, and no shared state with the
//! rest of the binary.
//!
//! # What is here and what is deliberately not
//!
//! The routing core is [`aep_driver`], and it is pure: it consumes an `Evaluation` and a
//! `TransitionResult` verbatim, never re-derives a verdict and never evaluates a gate. **The three
//! things that touch the world are here**, because they are the three things that cannot be in a
//! crate that claims to be deterministic:
//!
//! | this module | why it cannot be in `aep-driver` |
//! |---|---|
//! | running a program and reading its exit status | a process is the world |
//! | invoking a model | a network call, a credential and a transcript |
//! | pausing for a person | a terminal |
//! | the store lock, the pid-liveness probe and the run directory | a liveness probe reads ambient OS state and uses neither `SystemTime::now` nor `rand`, so a banned-token scan would not catch it. Placement is the only thing keeping the pure crate's claim true — review finding **F19** |
//!
//! # Exit codes
//!
//! | code | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | `0` | the run completed — or paused at an `operator` step **with** `--pause-on-approval`, which is what makes the flag opt-in: without it a green exit means finished, with it a green exit means finished **or** waiting, and a caller has to choose to be told that |
//! | `1` | the execution says no: blocked, a budget spent, a store that stopped parsing, a lock another run holds, a headless start that would cross a person |
//! | `2` | `clap`'s, for arguments it refuses |
//!
//! # What this driver does not do, stated rather than left to be discovered
//!
//! * **It never constructs an `Evidence::Approval` and never stamps `Producer::Human`**, under any
//!   flag. `approval_recorded` matches on subject and decision and does **not** check who granted
//!   it, so nothing below the driver would stop a harness minting its own approval: the refusal has
//!   to be the driver's, and it is a source scan in `aep-driver` rather than a promise here.
//! * **A command step's evidence carries a verdict, not counts.** An exit status says *the verifier
//!   ran and said yes or no*; it does not say how many tests passed. So a `test_result` minted here
//!   is the smallest result that carries the verdict — one passing or one failing — and a guard
//!   that reads `tests.unit.passed > 40` needs a step kind that reads a report, which this driver
//!   does not have. Named here rather than discovered later.
