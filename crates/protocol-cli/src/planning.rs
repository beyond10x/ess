//! `protocol artifact` — planning in the markdown store.
//!
//! The verb family an agent uses to plan work: create an epic, decompose it into stories, move one
//! to `active`, ask what the board looks like. Everything it touches is a markdown file in
//! `.engineering/planning/`, so the plan is reviewable in a pull request and its history is
//! `git log` rather than an export.
//!
//! # What lives here and what does not
//!
//! This is the first module split of `main.rs`, and the line is drawn where it costs nothing:
//! `Format`, the output macros, `print_table`, `print_serialised` and `exit_code` stay in the crate
//! root and are reached as `crate::` items, because they are shared with every other verb. What
//! moved is the verb family itself — its arguments, its rendering and its refusals — which shares
//! no state with anything else in the binary.
//!
//! # Exit codes
//!
//! `0` when the answer is yes, `1` when the store or a lifecycle says no. A refusal is *rendered*
//! rather than returned as an error, on the same reasoning `ess diff` gives for a pair it will not
//! compare: "a story cannot go straight from draft to implemented" is an answer about the input,
//! not a failure of this program.
