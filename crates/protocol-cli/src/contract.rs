//! `protocol contract evidence` — a contract runner's own record, given the envelope the engine
//! reads.
//!
//! The fifth module split, on the criterion the first four took: a verb family with its own input,
//! its own vocabulary and no shared state with the rest of the binary.
//!
//! # The seam this closes
//!
//! metaharness — private, and no dependency of this workspace — contract-tests each
//! `metaharness ⇄ vendor` adapter and prints the outcome as **one JSON object in the
//! `contract_result` shape this repository defines** (`metaharness conformance <kind> --contract`;
//! its `docs/design/adapter-contract-v0.1.md` § *Reuse of aep' tooling*, read
//! 2026-08-23). The intent stated there is that *"an EP-driven eval, or any consumer, reads an
//! adapter's conformance as a `contract_result` without knowing anything about metaharness's
//! internals"*.
//!
//! Until this verb existed, nothing here read one. The vocabulary crossed the boundary and no bytes
//! ever did — which is the same failure mode the frame document had before
//! `tests/metaharness_frame_contract.rs`, and the mirror image of it: that seam is *what this
//! repository mints, read by their rules*, and this one is *what they mint, read by ours*.
//!
//! # Why there is a verb at all, when the record already parses
//!
//! It parses. `Evidence` is tagged by `kind`, [`ContractResult`] is the payload, and
//! `{"kind":"contract_result","checked":20,…}` deserialises into `Evidence::ContractResult` with no
//! adapter, no second type and no new evidence kind. `protocols/aep/1.yaml` has declared
//! `contract_result`, the `contract-runner` verifier and `contracts.**` since the base protocol was
//! written, so no document changes either. That is the whole of what the shared vocabulary bought,
//! and it is most of the work.
//!
//! What a record on standard output does **not** carry is the *envelope* an evidence document
//! needs: `observed_at` and `producer`. `protocol evaluate --evidence` reads a list of records that
//! each state when somebody looked and what produced them, and the runner's object states neither.
//! So this verb supplies exactly those two fields and nothing else — it does not compute a verdict,
//! does not touch a count, and does not add a fact.
//!
//! # The producer is a constant, and the observation time is required
//!
//! The producer is [`PRODUCER`], the only class `EvidenceKind::ContractResult` names, for the same
//! reason `TraceEvidence::PRODUCER` is a constant: a caller that could name itself the verifier
//! would make the record's independence an input to the record.
//!
//! `--observed-at` is **required**, and that is the one place this verb is stricter than
//! `protocol trace evidence`. That verb defaults to now because the check runs in that process, in
//! that second. Here the check ran in another process, on another machine, possibly last week, and
//! the record carries no time of its own — so a default of *now* would be this binary stamping a
//! freshness it did not witness, and evidence horizons exist precisely to catch that (invariant 7:
//! a caller who has to write down when they looked cannot back-date by omission).
//!
//! # Two refusals, and why they are here rather than left to the engine
//!
//! `principles/development/contract-testing.yaml` states the discipline: *a run that checked
//! nothing also has zero failures, so the number of checks is part of the obligation.* It spells it
//! as `contracts.checked > 0`, and one might therefore expect a zero-checked record to be minted and
//! left for the engine to fail. Measured, that is not what happens — a `contract_result` with
//! `checked: 0` submitted against `examples/billing-conformance` reads:
//!
//! ```text
//! ✗ contracts.checked > 0                                     [principle contract-testing]
//! ✓ contracts.failed == 0                                     [principle contract-testing]
//! ✓ contracts.breaking_changes == 0                           [principle contract-testing]
//! ✓ evidence contract_result from contract-runner (independent)
//! ✓ contract-runner must run
//! ```
//!
//! Two of the three predicates pass *vacuously*, and — the part that matters — the **evidence
//! obligation is discharged**: the task now has its independent contract record and `contract-runner`
//! has run, on the strength of a run that checked nothing. So the refusal belongs at the boundary
//! where the record enters, not one layer later.
//!
//! The second refusal is `breaking_changes > failed`. A breaking change is a *subset* of the
//! failures on the producer's own definition, so a record claiming more of the subset than of the
//! set describes no run that could have happened; left alone it would let `contracts.failed == 0`
//! and `contracts.breaking_changes == 0` contradict each other inside one record.
//!
//! What is **not** refused is bad news. A record with `failed: 3` is minted without complaint and
//! exits `0`, exactly as `protocol trace evidence` writes down a run that gapped: the verdict belongs
//! in the record, and the engine is what decides on it. The two refusals are about a record that
//! *asserts nothing* and a record that *cannot describe any run* — never about one that reports a
//! failure.
//!
//! # What this does not buy
//!
//! Attestation. The record is YAML by the time the engine reads it, a person can type one, and the
//! digest in its provenance is a digest of bytes this process was handed rather than of bytes it
//! watched being produced. The same limit `trace-spec` and `ess-conformance` state about their own
//! records, and the same gap `docs/VISION.md` names.
