//! `protocol eval run` — the gates before a cent is spent, and what the manifest is read out of.
//!
//! # The binary is a tool, and a machine without it is not a red gate
//!
//! The evaluation programme's fourth design constant says it plainly: `metaharness` on `PATH` is a
//! *tool* dependency of the eval runner, like `git`, and an absent binary is a **skip by name**.
//! Every test here that would need it either skips and says so, or proves the refusal instead — and
//! the refusal is what a machine without the binary sees, so the two directions cover each other.
//! Nothing in this file calls a model, and nothing in it can spend money: the one test that walks
//! the whole spawn path points `METAHARNESS_BIN` at a shell script this file writes.
//!
//! # What the streams are
//!
//! Two of the fixtures are the committed eval corpus's own transcripts, ingested unchanged. Three
//! are under `crates/protocol-cli/fixtures/eval-run/`, derived from them — the derivation and what
//! is and is not observed about them is in that directory's `README.md`.
