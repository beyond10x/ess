An `obligation` is a commitment on a clock **nobody here controls**: a customer's deadline, a
regulator's window, a partner's delivery date.

```console
$ protocol artifact lifecycle obligation
obligation starts at open
  met -> nothing
  open -> met, slipped
  slipped -> met
```

{/* truncate */}

## The rung that justifies the kind

`slipped`. And the rule attached to it is the point of the whole release: **an obligation must never
gate a transition.**

A missed external deadline is a **fact to report**, not a **permission to withhold**. A tool that
let a slipped obligation block your work would have turned somebody else's missed date into your
blocked pull request — which is both unfair and useless, because you cannot fix it from here.

This is also why it is a second ladder rather than a widening of the existing status vocabulary.
`slipped` on `ArtifactStatus` would have been available to every kind, and something would
eventually have gated on it.

## Why `slipped -> met` exists

An obligation you missed and then satisfied is a real and common history. A ladder that made
`slipped` terminal would push people to avoid recording it in the first place — and the state you
most want recorded is the one nobody wants to write down.

## What it cost to add

A YAML file. No Rust change. This is the second kind added that way, and by this point the claim
`0.13.0` made has two releases of evidence behind it.
