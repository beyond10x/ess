This release started **ESS**, which specifies what software must exist, inside the repository that
originally hosted it.

The join is the point. A task can be blocked until something proves a specification is satisfied —
so the two halves meet at evidence rather than at an integration.

## What landed

* An **executable system specification** is a document this repository parses, validates and
  **refuses** — the refusals being the part that makes it a specification rather than a format.
* A workflow consumer could already **require conformance** to one through an adapter at its own
  boundary.

## What did not

Stated in the release itself rather than discovered by a reader: **nothing is generated from a
specification yet.** The compiler, the projections and the test synthesis are waves 2 and 3.

That habit — a release naming what it did not do — is worth more than it costs. A reader who finds
the gap themselves has learned something about the documentation as well as about the tool.

## What the review found

Reviewed by three independent agents. Both blockers were **a guard that could not guard**, and both
fixes generalise rather than patch:

* every published schema is now checked against every document this repository ships;
* the validation-code list is **generated** rather than maintained by hand.

Fixing the instance and leaving the class is how the same bug comes back under a different name.

642 tests.
