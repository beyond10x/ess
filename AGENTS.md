# AGENTS.md — aep

The contract for changing **this** repository. Read it before changing anything.

Org-wide rules — the naming convention, the language rule (anything that runs is Rust, not Python), the former-brand rule (atlas ADR 0001) and its four
exemption categories, and the rule that renaming anything another repo verifies is a coordinated
migration with an ADR — live in `atlas/AGENTS.md` and are not restated here.

`README.md` and `website/` orient a reader. This file says what must not break.

## Serves

The objectives of the collection this repository moves, by id from `atlas/ROADMAP.md` — the only
cross-repository roadmap, and the page that says what each id means and which evidence closes it:

- **O2 — decisions as data, with evidence.** Engineering method and system intent as typed, executable rules over evidence, with the artifact model running on the entity kernel (atlas ADR 0002).
- **O3 — any harness, observed and compared.** The governor both arms are measured under (atlas ADR 0004), and the four-arm eval that measures them.
- **O6 — self-improvement, built into all of it.** A driven run scores itself, and the planning store keeps the record the next run reads.

A change here that moves none of these is a question for the operator, not a task.
`atlas/scripts/check-map.sh` fails a repository whose `AGENTS.md` names no objective.

## What this repository is

A machine-executable specification of engineering methodology: principles, workflows, capabilities,
evidence and verification, expressed as typed Rust and generated JSON Schema rather than as prose in
a prompt. It is a **library and specification**, not an agent, a CI system or a deployment platform.

**The specification is the product; `integrations/` demonstrates it.** A plugin surface — a skill, an
agent charter — exists to show that a rule in `protocols/`, `principles/` or `workflows/` can be
carried by a real harness, and sometimes to find the shape of a rule that is not written down yet.
It is a reference projection, and it is deliberately allowed to run ahead of the YAML: a concept
proven in a surface is the evidence for the document that formalises it, which is the order
`crates/ess-domain/src/actor.rs:24-33` argues for when it refuses to ship a concept before the
evidence that made it necessary. What eventually drives these workflows deterministically is a
harness, and a harness reads the documents, not the surfaces. So the question to ask of anything
added under `integrations/` is *which rule does this demonstrate, and what would its formalisation
have to say* — never *is this the product*.

## Which documents are normative

Exactly two, and neither is the newest file in `docs/design/`:

* [`docs/design/consolidated-design-v0.2.md`](docs/design/consolidated-design-v0.2.md) — the
  specification for the protocol.
* [`docs/design/reconciliation-v0.2.md`](docs/design/reconciliation-v0.2.md) — what is implemented,
  and §5, the register of deliberate deviations.

When code and the consolidated design disagree, the document wins unless the disagreement is recorded
in the reconciliation register §5. Add to that list rather than diverging silently.

**Everything else in `docs/design/` is proposed until a plan page in `docs/plan/` — or a story in
`.engineering/planning/` — accepts it.** A proposal is not a work order, however long and however
recent it is. **There are two acceptance surfaces and you must check both**: a plan page, and the
store — `story:evidence-horizons` took up `evidence-horizons-design-v0.1.md` and shipped it without a
plan page ever existing, which is what the store is for. A design accepted either way is accepted.

**Do not implement from an unreviewed design, and do not treat one as evidence of what this
repository is.** [`docs/VISION.md`](docs/VISION.md) § *Proposed, not accepted* says what each would
add, and [`docs/plan/gap-register.md`](docs/plan/gap-register.md) holds every open gap with what
closes it. A design's own header can be stale — the accepting surface is what decides, not the
header.

### Refusals and partial acceptances that are still binding

A design accepted *in part* leaves named refusals behind. These are prohibitions, not backlog:

| design | what is refused, and by what |
|---|---|
| `ess-semantic-diff-impact-evolution-design-v0.1.md` | the proposal-evaluation loop and architecture search are **rejected outright**; everything past § 31 stays proposed |
| `ess-structural-synthesis-obligations-realizations-design-v0.1.md` | § 28 is **refused by invariant 6**; the obligation/`Realization` programme stays proposed (W7.4 takes a slice) |
| `transcript-conformance-design-v0.1.md` | the `regex` matcher of § 3.4 is **refused by name** — the workspace carries no regular-expression engine. Still proposed: assertions over the per-request usage series (§ 2.7), an expectation kind for the skill's own text entering context (§ 2.8), and a streaming checker (D5) |
| `fact-scoped-applicability-design-v0.1.md` | its first draft's claim that this finishes the governed run is **refused** — measured, `evidence.missing` goes 4 → 2, not 0. Its § 8 lists the five remaining blockers, § 9 the six follow-ups |
| `semantic-infrastructure-discovery-…-multicloud-design-v0.1.md` | reviewed and **deferred whole**; two ideas harvested |
| `story-completion-evidence-design-v0.1.md` | **accepted in part, 2026-08-28** — its own § 10, recorded also on `harness-wave-4-governed-dogfood.md` § W4.3 and on `story:completion-needs-evidence`. **Refused by name:** the engine judging a producer's *independence* from what it reports on as part of this rule — kept under `story:evidence-producers-for-the-driven-map`, with **D-S4** as the standing limit. **Accepted but not a work order yet:** § 2's principle and § 6.3's option B, which come into force only once a driven run has closed a story; until then the principle file is not written |
| `harness-wave-4-governed-dogfood.md` | the plan page itself stays **proposed**. Its W4.1 has been run once and **blocked in `establish_verifiers`**; the run is the finding and stays on that page rather than being repaired into a pass |

## Current state

**Do not write the current state here.** It drifted in this file's own first paragraphs and is
carried by surfaces that cannot:

| question | the surface that answers it |
|---|---|
| what is delivered, wave by wave | [`docs/status.md`](docs/status.md) — generated by `cargo xtask status` from the annotated tags and drift-checked in the gate |
| what each wave actually delivered | `git tag -n99` |
| whether it works | `task check` |
| what the document tree holds | `protocol validate` |
| what is open and what closes it | [`docs/plan/gap-register.md`](docs/plan/gap-register.md) |
| what is proposed and unaccepted | [`docs/VISION.md`](docs/VISION.md) § *Proposed, not accepted* |
| the work order | `docs/design/reconciliation-v0.2.md` § 4 (AEP), `docs/plan/ess-roadmap.md` (ESS), the gap register (everything outside a wave) |

Two counting rules follow from that, and both are prohibitions:

* **Prose states no count of the gate's own suites or tests.** Four hand-written ones drifted apart
  in this repository's first 48 hours. That number lives in exactly one place: the gate's output.
* **A count of something a command prints on demand is written down with the command that produces
  it** — documents in the tree, artifacts in the store, records in a corpus — so a reader can re-run
  it rather than believe it.

Keep `docs/status.md` accurate when you land work; `cargo xtask status` regenerates it.

## Rules the components carry

Each of these was learned by building the thing it names. They are enforced where they are stated.

### Boundaries between this repository and its neighbours

* **Vocabulary crosses to `metaharness`; a dependency never does.** This repository is public and
  that one is not. `aep` appears in no `Cargo.toml` there and no crate of theirs
  appears in one here.
* **`entity-runtime` is a dependency — five crates, one tag — and the arrow only points this way.**
  `crates/aep-backend-entity` takes `entity-core` and `entity-store` by git tag so the status ladder
  is decided as data rather than by a lookup written here (`src/kernel.rs`, re-exported by
  `aep-backend-markdown`); `crates/aep-backend-sqlite` and `crates/aep-backend-postgres` take
  `entity-sqlite` and `entity-postgres`, and `crates/aep-backend-hybrid` takes `entity-remote` for
  its `Hybrid`, all at the **same** tag, and `dep-check` in the gate
  (`cargo xtask deps`) fails, naming both, when any `entity-*` crate resolves at two versions or from
  two pins — two kernels were compiled side by side for two releases before it existed. Nothing of
  ours appears in a manifest of `entity-runtime`'s, at any
  version, ever — that is `atlas/architecture/adr/0002`, and it is the reason the arrow is safe: a
  kernel that never depends on its adopter cannot be shaped by one. The verdicts are held identical
  by `tests/kernel_equivalence.rs`, which is what makes the dependency reversible: delete the module
  and the lookup it replaced still stands behind it.
* **The one artifact that crosses is pinned.** A step's surface travels as a sealed
  `metaharness.frame/1` document. The reader is **transcribed, not linked** —
  `crates/protocol-cli/tests/metaharness_frame_contract.rs` checks tag, then shape, then digest, **in
  that order**, and produces the named refusal for a mutation of each class. The golden bytes are
  `crates/protocol-cli/fixtures/metaharness-frame-canonical.json`, minted by the driver's own code
  path; the other side pins the same bytes. Changing the format is a coordinated migration under the
  atlas rule, not an edit.
* **Harness-specific readers are `metaharness`'s; the trace *vocabulary* is ours.** The division is
  that `metaharness` normalises each vendor's format and this repository decides against the
  result: `crates/trace-spec/src/event_stream.rs` reads `metaharness.event/1`, and that is the
  production path. Two direct vendor readers predate it and stay for stated reasons —
  `src/adapter.rs` (Claude Code `stream-json`), and `src/codex.rs`, which exists to answer gap
  `:38`, *harness neutrality has never met a second harness*, by proving one specification decides
  two shapes. **Neither is the verified reader for its harness.**
  `metaharness/crates/metaharness-codex/src/rollout.rs` is, and it says so: verified against the
  binary and **2,437 real rollout files**, where ours is checked against **two committed synthetic
  fixtures** that `crates/trace-spec/tests/codex_rollout.rs:18` labels as synthetic. A neutrality
  probe on constructed bytes is a real answer to a real gap and is not a claim to read anybody's
  transcripts in production. **Do not add a third vendor reader here** — normalise it in
  `metaharness` and read `metaharness.event/1`.
* **The evaluation machinery and its corpus are here; the paid runs and their results are not.**
  The split is finer than *evals moved to metaharness*, so it is written out rather than
  remembered:

  | here | there |
  |---|---|
  | the runner, `protocol eval` (`crates/protocol-cli/src/eval.rs`) | the workflows, prompts and trace expectations a run is judged against (`metaharness/evals/aep/`) |
  | the eval-case corpus (`conformance/eval/`), five cases with the verdict each declares | every recorded stream and matrix from a **paid** run |
  | synthetic proof streams (`crates/protocol-cli/fixtures/eval-run/`), labelled synthetic where they are used | anything that spawned a vendor binary or spent money |

  There is **no `evals/` directory here** and no observed transcript is committed here; what is
  committed is constructed, and every place it is used says so. The rules are public; the runs are
  not.
* **The scanner is a separate repository because it holds the credentials.** `ess-kubernetes` reaches a
  cluster; **nothing here reaches a network** (see the gate's network rule). Secrets appear in
  `infra-domain` only ever as digests (IW1).
* **Nothing adopter-internal is written into a file here.** The first adopter's review is held by the
  operator and is not in this tree; only the triage of it is (`epic:adopter-feedback-round-1`, and
  the gap register's *first adopter's report* section).

### Evidence and labelling

* **`provider_emulated` is never promoted, and neither is a constructed stream.** Committed eval
  streams are structurally faithful and **not observed**; say so wherever they are used.
* **A verdict of `null` or absent counts *unobservable*, never *held*.** `protocol eval matrix`
  exits `0` whatever the table says: a matrix is a report, and an exit code that moved with the
  counts would be the scalar this programme refuses to compute.
* **A field somebody forgot must not be able to claim a fact.** `plugin_digest` and `model` must be
  *written* — a digest, or an explicit `null`. A missing key is refused by name
  (`EVAL-MANIFEST-*`, `EVAL-RECORD-*`, `EVAL-PAIR-*`, `EVAL-RUN-*`, `EVAL-CASE-*`, `EVAL-STREAM-*`),
  not defaulted.
* **The plugin digest comes from the instrument's own record**
  (`session.started.hermetic.installed_plugins`), never from the vendor's top-level `plugins` echo.
* **Three contract records are refused where they enter**, not left to the engine: `checked: 0`,
  which would discharge `contract-testing`'s evidence obligation on a run that checked nothing;
  `breaking_changes > failed`, which describes no run; and a record stating no count at all, because
  each defaults to zero and zero on `breaking_changes` is the claim a gate reads as a pass. A record
  reporting failures **is still written down** — the verdict belongs in the record.
* **`failed` and `breaking_changes` are different questions.** `failed` is *the contract run is red*,
  which is what a review is for; `breaking_changes` is *a consumer was told something that is no
  longer true*, which no reviewer can decide. A run that never heard from a contract runner leaves
  the count `Unknown` and does not pass.
* **A dogfood wave that reports only its successes measures nothing.** A blocked run stays recorded
  as blocked. **Built is not adopted**: one story driven once says the mechanism holds on real work;
  it does not say driven runs are how work happens here.
* **`trace_conformance` still gates nothing.** Do not describe it as if it does.
* **A claim the suites do not support is not made.** As of 2026-08-26 the contract has **three**
  implementors: `aep-backend-memory`, `aep-backend-markdown` and `aep-backend-sqlite`. The sixteen
  suites run against all three, each beside a deliberately faulty version of itself — a suite that
  has never failed is not evidence that it can. `aep-backend-sqlite` is
  `aep-backend-entity::EntityBackend<SqliteStore>` — the one adapter over any `entity_store::Store`,
  whose suites run in that crate over `SqliteStore` **and** `MemoryStore` — and wave G makes the
  markdown backend the same type over a provider of its own (`docs/plan/store-waves-f-g-h.md`).
  Neither durable backend reimplements the contract: each hands every command to
  `aep-backend-memory` and adds durability, so idempotency, revision conflicts and the audit a
  refusal still leaves are decided in one place.
  **D-P1 is closed** — `docs/plan/gap-register.md` carries what that took.

### The driver and the engine

* **Gates are evaluated only by the engine.** The driver asks and does what it is told.
* **The engine's deny wins over the policy's allow.** Every admitted call is rendered as an
  `ActionRequest` and put to `Engine::authorize`, so the execution's own event record holds what was
  refused and what was done.
* **There is one policy and one enforcer.** Every `llm` step spawns through `metaharness run claude`
  in ask mode; `decide_tool` in `crates/protocol-cli/src/drive.rs` answers each call and the decision
  is recorded as a `tool.decided` event in the run's own stream. Do not add a second enforcement
  path.
* **Nothing in the trace crates calls a model or reads a clock.** Every duration and every cost comes
  out of the transcript, which is what lets a report be committed and diffed.
* **A key present and `null` reads `unk` and never a pass**, and what a wire cannot answer is named
  where it is read.

### Paid runs

* **Nothing spawns without `METAHARNESS_LIVE=1` *and* `--budget-usd`**, and the cap is checked
  **before each launch** against `--assume-usd-per-run` — a cap enforced afterwards is a receipt. A
  run the wire prices `null` counts at the assumed rate *and* states no cost in its manifest.
* **`metaharness` is used as a tool, the way `git` is** — found on `PATH` or via `METAHARNESS_BIN`.
  Absent, `protocol eval run` refuses by name with **exit 2**, its own code, so a machine without it
  skips rather than reddening.
* **Arm `raw` gets the committed instruction document in front of the task; arm `plugin` gets the
  task alone** — the plugin *is* arm b's treatment. **Arm `driven` is a named refusal** pointing at
  `protocol drive run`. Three refusals guard the experiment itself: the treated arm without its
  treatment, the control arm with one, and a plugin attested without the digest saying which bytes it
  was.

## Invariants

These hold across the workspace. Breaking one is a design change, not a refactor.

Each carries what actually enforces it — a lint, a type, a test or a scan — because a rule nothing
checks is a rule that has already drifted somewhere. Three said **nothing** until the wave 6.5
hardening batch; none does now, and the register is only useful while it is honest. Do not write an
enforcement here that you cannot point at.

1. **Rust is the source of truth.** Schemas are generated. Never hand-edit `schemas/generated/`; run
   `cargo xtask schema`.
   *Enforced by* `schema-check` in the gate (`cargo xtask schema --check`), which fails if the
   committed schemas differ from the types.
2. **Parse, then validate.** Documents deserialize into a `Raw*` type and become a domain type
   through `TryFrom`. Validated types do **not** implement `Deserialize`, so the only way to obtain
   one is to validate. Do not add `Deserialize` to a validated type to save a conversion.
   *Enforced by* a source scan, `crates/aep-domain/tests/invariants.rs`, over ten
   `Raw*`→validated pairs. It asserts the inverse too — the same extractor must *find* `Deserialize`
   on each `Raw*` — so a scan that has silently stopped working fails instead of passing.
3. **Validation accumulates.** A document with four broken references reports four errors. Push into
   `ValidationErrors`; do not return on the first failure.
   *Enforced by* per-type tests that assert an exact count rather than "is an error" — for example
   `crates/ess-domain/src/component.rs` expects four from one pass and
   `crates/aep-domain/src/domain_event.rs` expects three. There is no workspace-wide check: a new
   validator that returns early passes the gate.
4. **Every validation failure carries a stable `ValidationCode`.** Tests match on codes, never on
   message text.
   *Enforced by* the type — `ValidationError.code` is not optional — and by the `validation_codes!`
   macro in `crates/aep-domain/src/error.rs`, which generates `ValidationCode::ALL` from the same line
   as the variant, after five codes had fallen out of a hand-maintained list.
5. **`Unknown` is not `False`.** Predicate evaluation is three-valued; only `True` permits a
   transition. Never collapse unobserved to false. **A lapsed fact takes the same road**: past its
   requirement's horizon an observation stops counting and the requirement reads `Unknown`, never
   `False`, and the lapsed record's facts are withheld so a guard reading them refuses too. Nobody
   has looked lately is not the same finding as it is broken, and only one of them is fixed by
   changing code.
   *Enforced by* the `Truth` type: three variants, Kleene `and`/`or`, no `From<bool>` and no
   `as_bool`, so there is no boolean to collapse into. The Kleene tables have tests, the algebra's
   laws are property-checked over generated expressions
   (`crates/aep-domain/tests/truth_laws.rs`), and the decay is covered by
   `crates/aep-engine/tests/evidence_horizons.rs`. One deliberate exception is recorded rather than
   hidden: `evidence.missing` is a count, so `evidence.missing == 0` reads `False` on a lapse —
   pre-existing polarity of a count, and the reason `evidence.lapsed` exists beside it (gap
   register D-7).
6. **Capabilities default to deny**, and `deny` beats `require_approval` beats `allow`. A principle
   may restrict; only a profile or protocol may grant.
   *Enforced by* `CapabilityPolicy::decide` plus tests that first construct the state where each link
   decides anything: `a_denied_capability_is_not_downgraded_to_requiring_an_approval`
   (`crates/aep-domain/src/capability.rs`) asserts its fixture holds one capability in all three sets
   before asserting the outcome, and `crates/aep-domain/tests/safety_envelope.rs` covers the approval
   floor. Verified by mutation, not by reading.
7. **The engine never manufactures evidence, and it does not decide when the observation happened.**
   It evaluates what verifiers and humans produced. `observed_at` is the caller's and is required —
   there is no default, because a caller who has to write down when they looked cannot back-date by
   omission — and a submission claiming a future observation is refused rather than accepted as a
   fresh record. What the engine still stamps is the record's own envelope: the id, the clock time
   it was submitted at, and the producer.
   *Enforced by* a source scan, `crates/aep-engine/tests/evidence_scan.rs`, which reads the payload
   types off `Evidence` itself and refuses any construction of one in shipped engine code — struct
   literal, constructor path, variant expression or variant-as-function. Destructuring and the
   envelope stamp in `submit_evidence` stay allowed: reading evidence and stamping the id, clock
   time and producer onto a caller's payload are the engine's job. The scan's extractor is checked
   against the engine's own test modules, which construct evidence constantly, so a scan that has
   stopped seeing constructions fails on them instead of passing on everything. The rule reaches the
   driver too, one layer up and with a narrower ban:
   `crates/aep-driver/tests/evidence_scan.rs` refuses any construction of an `Evidence::Approval` or
   a `Producer::Human` in shipped driver code, because nothing below the driver would stop a harness
   from writing its own approval and unlocking a capability with it.
8. **The domain crate is clock-free and randomness-free.** No `SystemTime::now`, no RNG. The engine
   takes a `Clock` so an execution is replayable.
   *Enforced by* a banned-token scan, `crates/aep-domain/tests/determinism.rs` — boundary-aware,
   because `Operand::` contains `rand::`, and comment-skipping, because prose about the rule is not
   a breach of it. `aep-engine` is deliberately unscanned: `src/clock.rs` is the one place
   `SystemTime::now` is allowed to live, behind the `Clock` trait.
9. **Determinism.** Same validated state plus same evidence set ⇒ same decision. Iterate over
   `BTreeMap`/`BTreeSet`, never `HashMap`, so output ordering is stable.
   *Enforced by* banned-token scans over thirteen crates that claim the property or feed one that
   does — `ess-compiler` (`tests/billing.rs`), `ess-diff` (`tests/canonical.rs`), `ess-synth`
   (`tests/synthesis.rs`), `aep-domain`, `ess-gen`, `infra-domain`, `infra-compiler`,
   `infra-analyze`, `infra-project`, `infra-spec`, `aep-driver-spec`, `aep-driver` and `aep-render`
   (`tests/determinism.rs` in each) — beside tests that compile, diff, generate
   or render twice and compare bytes, and a seeded property test that does the same for every
   generated adversarial specification (`crates/ess-compiler/tests/adversarial.rs`).
   Three of the thirteen are the harness's. § 4.1 makes a purity claim for the two driver crates
   stronger than `aep-engine`'s: the routing core is clock-free and randomness-free, and the store
   lock, the pid-liveness probe and the run directory are `protocol-cli`'s precisely because a probe
   reads ambient OS state and would slip past this scan. `aep-render`'s scan is stronger again and
   bans **floats** as well, because its criterion is not *the same decision twice* but *the same
   bytes twice* — a committed figure that regenerates differently is a diff nobody chose — and the
   `--watch` loop, its poll interval and the terminal live in `protocol-cli` for the same reason the
   lock does.
   Deliberately unscanned, because each owns a clock or a terminal: `aep-engine` (invariant 8),
   `ess-conformance` (the runner takes a clock, wave 3.5 decision 3), the backends, the CLI and
   `xtask`. `ess-domain` states no determinism claim of its own.
10. **Document identity comes from document content**, not from filenames. A workflow's `id` is
    declared inside the file; loaders index by declared id.
    *Enforced by* the registry's signatures: `Registry::insert_*` takes a validated document and no
    path (`crates/aep-engine/src/registry.rs`), so there is no filename available to index by.
11. **Every public item is documented** (`missing_docs = "warn"`) and the workspace is
    clippy-pedantic clean.
    *Enforced by* `missing_docs` and `clippy::pedantic` in `[workspace.lints]`, raised to errors by
    the `clippy` step's `-D warnings`, plus the `doc-check` step (`RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings`) for
    broken intra-doc links. All twenty-nine workspace members opt in with `[lints] workspace = true`;
    a new crate that omits that line is outside every lint here.
12. **No `unsafe`** (`unsafe_code = "forbid"`).
    *Enforced by* that lint in `[workspace.lints.rust]`. `forbid` cannot be lifted by an inner
    `allow`, so this one is closed rather than merely checked — again, for the twenty-nine members
    that opt in. **One crate cannot declare it and says so**: a `WebAssembly` export is a `#[no_mangle]`
    item, which rustc's own `unsafe_code` lint flags, so the emitted browser bridge under
    `generated/web/` and the host that links a realization into it (`examples/billing-web`, excluded
    from the workspace for exactly this reason) declare `#![deny(missing_docs)]` alone. Neither
    contains an `unsafe` block, an `unsafe fn` or a raw-pointer dereference; the property holds and
    the compiler is no longer the thing closing it, which is a named weakening in the bridge's own
    `TARGET.md` and a test in `crates/ess-synth/tests/web.rs`.
13. **Identity is opaque.** An `EntityId` is never parsed for meaning. A human-readable key belongs in
    the `EntityLocator`; the moment code reads structure out of an id, identity has become a key again.
    *Enforced by* the type: `EntityId(String)` has a private field and no structural accessor, and
    `EntityId::new` refuses anything under twelve characters, which is what catches `AUTH-142` going
    in as identity. Nothing stops code parsing the `Display` output back out.
14. **Every mutation is a command.** There is no second write path, because a second path is a second
    place to forget validation, authorisation, idempotency, provenance and audit.
    *Enforced by* `crates/aep-contract/tests/write_surface.rs`, which enumerates every method of
    every public trait in the contract and pins the list: `CommandService::execute` is the one
    write path. A new trait or method — required or default-bodied — fails the test with
    instructions to model the mutation as a command payload, or to change this invariant first.
15. **A refused command changes nothing and is still recorded.** `AuditRecord::validate` rejects a
    rejection that carries a change record.
    *Enforced by* `AuditRecord::validate` (`crates/aep-domain/src/audit.rs`) and its tests.
16. **Nothing is physically deleted.** `ArchiveEntity` and `SupersedeEntity` are the vocabulary.
    *Enforced by* the command vocabulary — there is no delete variant to call — and by a test that
    `CommandKind::parse("aep.entity.delete/v1")` fails, naming the kind it refused
    (`crates/aep-domain/src/command.rs`).
17. **A horizon lives on the requirement, and nothing mutates one.** How long an observation is
    worth something is a property of the question being asked, not of the observation — two
    requirements may legitimately read one record on different clocks. The refresh that is allowed
    is *observe again and write a new date*; there is deliberately no `extend`, because if
    extending were as easy to call as re-checking it is the one that gets called, every time, by
    whoever is trying to get a gate green.
    *Enforced by* three mechanisms in decreasing order of strength: an evidence record has **no
    horizon field**, so there is nothing on a record to mutate; a requirement's horizon comes from
    a parsed document and is re-read on every resolve, so an in-memory change does not survive; and
    a source scan over the five crates a horizon can be reached from,
    `crates/aep-domain/tests/horizon_immutability.rs`, refuses a mutator a later edit would
    otherwise add without argument. `Horizon::days` also refuses zero and anything over ten years,
    so a typo cannot become a horizon nothing will outlive.

```

Twenty steps in `Taskfile.yml`, and CI runs every one. Twelve are listed below in order; the
other seven are `plan-check`, `version-check`, `dep-check` (`cargo xtask deps`: every `entity-*`
crate resolves once, from one `entity-runtime` pin), `guard-check` and `claim-check` between
`status-check` and `clippy` — source-only and sub-second — then `postgres-check` after `test` (the
Postgres backend's tests against the server `ENTITY_POSTGRES_URL` names, or one printed line saying
they did not run), and `lab-check` before `msrv`.

**`plan-check` is `protocol artifact validate` over this repository's own store**, added 2026-08-28
on `story:own-engineering-store`'s stated default. It fails on an unparseable document, a relation
into a repository the workspace manifest does not declare, or a status no lifecycle permits — and
**reports without failing** on a status reached on an assertion rather than a record, which is
`story:completion-needs-evidence`'s deliberate position. It runs from the repository root and from
any directory inside it; that it did not, until the same day, was the defect `story:own-engineering-store`
recorded against itself.

**`audit-check` is the drift detector of `docs/guide/open-vocabulary.md`**, added 2026-08-28: seven
of the thirteen units of `.engineering/checks/`, four seconds, re-resolving every `file:line` the
audit cites. It exists because a citation rotted silently — `20923a8` added eight doc-comment lines
above `pub enum EvidenceKind`, so a *closed* verdict came to point at a serde attribute, and the
suite that catches exactly this was not in the gate, so the story resting on it stayed
`implemented` on a record that had stopped being true. Six units are not in the gate, for two reasons. Four run the suite
itself (nine tree copies for the mutation proof) and cost 65 of its 70 seconds; run them with `bash
.engineering/checks/run.sh` when the suite changes. The fifth, `audit-corpus`, is out because its C9
row reads `git status` and asserts *this unit's writes stayed inside its two declared files* — a
claim about the **run** that produced the audit, not about the tree, so in a gate it reddens on any
unrelated uncommitted file. A check that cannot pass on a dirty tree is a run verifier, not a gate
step. **The suite reads the store with this tree's own
build**, never the ambient `protocol`: the version is checked and a mismatch is a refusal, because a
stale install reported five phantom drifted stories on 2026-08-28 and nothing said why.

1. `fmt-check` — `cargo xtask fmt --check`, which formats exactly the workspace members. Not
   `cargo fmt --all`: that flag also reaches every member's local path dependencies, which since
   `examples/billing-realization` would hand the synthesised workspaces under `generated/rust/`
   to rustfmt — and their bytes are the emitter's, held byte-identical by `synth-check`.
2. `status-check` — `cargo xtask status --check`, which fails if the delivered-waves table in
   `docs/status.md` no longer matches what the annotated tags record. The one status surface that
   kept going stale by hand is derived instead; the fix is `cargo xtask status`.
3. `clippy` — `--workspace --all-targets -D warnings`, which is also what turns `missing_docs` and
   `clippy::pedantic` from warnings into failures.
4. `test` — `cargo test --workspace`.
5. `doc-check` — `cargo doc --workspace --no-deps` with `RUSTDOCFLAGS=-D warnings`. Doc comments carry
   the design reasoning here, so a broken intra-doc link loses an argument, not a hyperlink.
6. `schema-check` — `cargo xtask schema --check`.
7. `generate-check` — `cargo xtask generate --check`, which fails if the committed projections under
   `generated/` differ from what the specification produces.
8. `suite-check` — `cargo xtask suite --check`, which fails if the committed conformance suites under
   `suites/generated/` differ from what the specifications produce. A suite is a contract an
   implementation is checked against, so a stale one certifies the wrong thing.
9. `infra-check` — `cargo xtask infra --check`, which fails if the committed observation IR,
   simulation, drift or projection tree under `examples/k3d-dev-cluster/` differs from what its
   inputs produce — including a projection file nothing generates any more. (This step was in the
   Taskfile and CI before it was in this list; the list was itself a stale copy.)
10. `synth-check` — `cargo xtask synth --check`, which fails if any committed synthesised tree —
   `generated/rust/`, `generated/go/` and `generated/web/`, three emitters behind one
   language-neutral plan, for two specifications — differs from what the specifications determine; if a matching tree no
   longer builds (`cargo check` for the Rust workspace; `gofmt -l` empty, `go build ./...` and
   `go vet ./...` for the Go module; `cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown` for
   the browser bridge and for the host that links a realization into it); if the emitted page calls
   an export its module does not have, or the module exports one no page names — HTML's version of
   a dangling reference, checked against the compiled module's own export table because nothing in
   a browser would refuse it; if the committed billing suite no longer holds against the workspace
   linked with `examples/billing-realization`, where the honest linkage must pass all 29 scenarios
   and the deliberately corrupted one must fail exactly the scenario that exists to catch it; or if
   the browser boundary no longer holds — the realized module is loaded outside a browser through
   the page's own `bridge.js` and driven through one round trip, and seventeen claims about it must
   stand; or if the **dual-target demonstration** stops holding — the two applications synthesised
   from `examples/gatepass/` are built from the committed trees plus their hand-written
   realizations, started on ephemeral ports, and compared on their startup records outside
   `runtime`, on the status and the body of seven exchanges, and on the two documents they publish
   about themselves byte for byte. A tree that matches its specification and still fails here is a
   defect in `ess-synth` or in the realization, not in any specification.

   **It needs the Go toolchain, the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target and Node**, and says which is
   missing rather than skipping — a check that quietly passes without its toolchain reads exactly
   like a check that passed. `cargo test` needs all three too, because `xtask`'s own tests write
   all three trees and build them.

11. `msrv` — `cargo +1.85 build --workspace --locked`. `--locked` is the point: the failure this
   catches arrives **through the lockfile**, with no commit of ours touching a line of Rust. A
   transitive dependency raising *its own* `rust-version` breaks the declared MSRV, and
   `idna_adapter@1.2.2` pulling `icu_*@2.3.0` (rustc 1.88) did exactly that.
12. `website` — `npm run build` in `website/`. Docusaurus resolves every markdown link at build
   time, so a link from a page under `website/docs/` into the repository tree fails the build
   rather than 404ing for a reader. Repository files are linked by absolute GitHub URL; only site
   pages are linked relatively.

   **Steps 11 and 12 were in CI and not in `task check` for eleven consecutive releases** — every
   tag from 0.13.0 to 0.23.1 — and CI was red the whole time behind a green local gate. A gate that
   covers less than the gate it claims to be is worse than one that admits its scope; that is why
   this list and `Taskfile.yml` are checked against each other by hand whenever either changes.

Land nothing that does not pass all twenty.

**A green local gate does not guarantee a green CI.** The steps mirror each other exactly, but the
*toolchain* does not: CI installs whatever `stable` is on the day, and a newer clippy can introduce a
lint that fails a commit which passed locally on an older one. That is how `clippy::unused_async`
turned `main` red on a commit whose gate was green. Run `rustup update` before pushing anything you
will not get a second chance at — and when CI fails on a lint that did not exist locally, that is the
cause, not a flaky gate.

**A release is the procedure in § *Releases*, and nothing mechanical enforces it.** A wave ships,
`CHANGELOG.md` is cut under its heading, `cargo xtask status` regenerates the delivered-waves record
and the annotated tag is written at the commit that delivered the work. The full gate comes first —
component gates are not enough — and no hook, task or CI job checks that it did, which makes it a
discipline rather than a guarantee. It has already slipped once, and the mechanism is worth
knowing: `task check 2>&1 | tail` reports **`tail`'s** exit status, not the gate's, so two runs that
aborted at the first step read as green and two commits were pushed claiming a gate that had never
run past `fmt-check`. Read the gate's own status, not a pipeline's.

**Two worktrees must not share a `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`.** Learned 2026-08-29, at the cost of about
three gate runs per agent in a four-agent wave. `cargo xtask` resolves the repository root from
`env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`, baked in at build time — so a shared target handed one worktree the
other's `xtask`, and `cargo xtask schema` run in tree A rewrote `schemas/generated/` in tree B.
Test binaries were served across trees the same way: a `task check` in one tree ran a test that
did not exist in it, and an `aep-engine` without a new method linked against an `aep-domain` that
had it. `crates/protocol-cli/tests/store_selection.rs` asserts `CARGO_TARGET_TMPDIR` lies under
the repository root and fails eleven tests whenever the target is elsewhere. Each worktree builds
into its own `target/`; when disk is short, remove a finished worktree's target rather than
sharing a live one, and treat `touch`ing sources as a symptom, not a fix.

**Test fixtures on disk carry the process id in their path.** The same day, the markdown
backend's `scratch(name)` opened `$TMPDIR/aep-markdown-store/<name>` and began with
`remove_dir_all`; `TMPDIR` is one directory for every session and worktree on this machine, so two
gates running at once deleted each other's fixtures mid-test — one read 1 failed, the other 0, both
true. Proved without load: two concurrent runs, 52 passed against 50 passed / 2 failed; with the
pid in the path, 52 and 52 (8c57794). A fixture path a second process can compute is a fixture a
second process will delete.

## Safety envelope

This repository publishes a **public** specification and drives real agent runs. Both are exposed
surfaces.

* **The published API is the document tree and the generated schemas.** A changed fact spelling, a
  new document kind, or a rule that now refuses what it used to allow is visible to every adopter —
  including the one outside this org. It gets a `CHANGELOG.md` line in the same commit (see
  *Changelog*), and a wire-visible identifier change is a coordinated migration with an ADR in
  `atlas`, not an edit.
* **The engine never manufactures evidence** (invariant 7), and the driver may not manufacture an
  approval: `crates/aep-driver/tests/evidence_scan.rs` refuses any construction of an
  `Evidence::Approval` or a `Producer::Human` in shipped driver code, because nothing below the
  driver would stop a harness writing its own approval and unlocking a capability with it.
* **No document this repository ships may tell its reader to write the planning store by hand.**
  `protocol artifact` is the store's only writer and every surface under `integrations/` says so in
  prose — which is where the rule regressed once already, when the planning skill *told* agents to
  patch bodies directly and nothing in the repository read a skill's text.
  *Enforced by* a source scan over shipped prose,
  `crates/protocol-cli/tests/plugin_surface_store_writes.rs`, which reads every `*.md` under
  `integrations/` sentence by sentence and refuses a write verb that reaches a store surface —
  frontmatter, `status:`, a body, a path under `.engineering/planning/`. Naming the CLI is not an
  exemption when the sentence routes around it, a prohibition exempts its own clause and not the
  sentence, and all seventeen documents are pinned by name in both directions, so a walk that
  stopped finding the agent charters fails instead of passing over a third of the corpus. Not
  scanned, and a known gap: `plugin.json`'s `longDescription` and `defaultPrompt`, and the prose in
  `integrations/codex/eval/check-instruction-surface.sh`.
* **Capabilities default to deny** (invariant 6). `development.driven` is the only profile that
  grants a shell, and it is held to the `protocol` CLI by the driver's own per-call policy. Widening
  a profile's grant is a specification change with a design page, never a convenience.
* **A horizon cannot be extended, only re-observed** (invariant 17). There is deliberately no
  `extend`: if extending were as easy to call as re-checking, it is the one that gets called by
  whoever is trying to get a gate green.
* **Nothing in `task check` reaches the network** except `postgres-check`, opted into by
  `ENTITY_POSTGRES_URL` and silent-by-name without it, and no gate step spends money. Paid runs are
  governed by the rules in *Rules the components carry* § *Paid runs* and are not part of any gate.
* **Never commit a credential, a token, a real transcript that carries one, or anything
  adopter-internal.**

## Out of scope

This is a library and a specification. It is not an agent, a CI system or a deployment platform.

| Belongs elsewhere | Where |

| Scanning a cluster; anything holding a kubeconfig | `ess-kubernetes` |
| The b10x agent loop | `harness` |
| Sandboxed execution | `substrate` |
| The paid evaluation machinery and its recorded results | `metaharness`, under `evals/aep/` |
| Cross-repo decisions and the map | `atlas` |

## Conventions

* **Tests live beside the code** they test, in a `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`. Name a test after the
  behaviour it protects, not the function it calls: `an_approval_of_version_three_does_not_cover_version_seven`.
* **Every test asserts a reason.** Prefer `expect_err` plus a check on the `ValidationCode` over
  `assert!(result.is_err())`.
* **A test must reach the state where the rule is load-bearing.** A precedence rule needs a fixture
  that populates both sides; a refusal rule needs a refusal in the fixture. A test that would pass
  whether or not the rule holds is not a test of the rule, whatever its name says. Where reaching that
  state takes work, assert that the fixture reached it before asserting the outcome — see
  `a_denied_capability_is_not_downgraded_to_requiring_an_approval` in
  `crates/aep-domain/src/capability.rs`.
* **Verify a guard by breaking it.** Before trusting a new test, apply the one-line mutation it is
  meant to catch, watch it fail with a message that names the defect, and revert. A test that still
  passes under the mutation was never guarding anything; a test that fails with an unreadable message
  costs the next reader an hour.
* **Rust CLIs use `clap`'s derive API.** Hand-rolled argument parsing is not accepted.
* **Task runner is `Taskfile.yml`** (go-task). Do not add a Makefile.
* **Comments explain why**, and only where the reason is not evident from the code. Doc comments on
  public items explain what the type is *for*, and where a design decision is embedded in it, why.
* **Claim ids are singular and shared.** A verification claim is a fact path segment
  (`verification.<claim>.passed`), so `invariant` and `invariants` are different claims and evidence
  for one does not satisfy a requirement for the other. Existing claims: `precondition`,
  `postcondition`, `invariant`, `hypothesis`, `recovery`, `blast-radius`, `clean-room`,
  `differential`, `mutation`, `migration`, `dry-run`. Reuse one before inventing another.
* **`<claim>_verified` is projected but not observable.** The engine emits it, but no protocol
  declares the bare namespace, so a predicate cannot read it — except `recovery_verified`, which
  `aop/1` declares explicitly for the incident profile. Write `verification.<claim>.passed` instead.
* **Wire-format aliases are deliberate.** `unit_tests.failed` alongside `tests.unit.failed`,
  `test_execution` alongside `test_result`: both spellings appear in the design documents. Canonical
  forms are what the engine emits; aliases are only accepted on input, and each is documented on the
  type that projects it.

## Dependencies

Written down because it is already practised, and an unwritten standard is one the next agent meets
only by violating it.

* **The workspace has sixteen direct third-party crates.** Twelve are declared once in
  `[workspace.dependencies]`: seven from crates.io — `serde`, `serde_json`, `serde_yaml`,
  `schemars`, `thiserror`, `clap`, `anyhow` — and `entity-runtime`'s **five** by **git tag** —
  `entity-core`, `entity-store`, `entity-sqlite`, `entity-postgres`, `entity-remote`
  (`Cargo.toml:112-116`, all at tag `0.13.0`) — the only
  dependencies not taken by version: they are not on crates.io, a ladder's verdicts are a published surface that must
  not move under us, and **one tag, declared once,** is what `dep-check` enforces after two kernels
  were compiled side by side for two releases (`aep-backend-markdown` takes `entity-core`;
  `aep-backend-entity` takes `entity-core` and `entity-store`; `aep-backend-sqlite` takes
  `entity-sqlite`; `aep-backend-postgres` takes `entity-postgres`, which brings `postgres` 0.19
  without default features and no TLS backend — the connection is the caller's, by URL;
  `aep-backend-hybrid` takes `entity-remote` for `Hybrid`, which brings nothing further). Four are
  crate-local: `sha2` wherever a document is content-addressed (`aep-engine`, `aep-driver-spec`,
  `ess-gen`, `infra-compiler`, `infra-domain`, `protocol-cli`, `trace-domain`, and as a
  dev-dependency of `aep-backend-markdown`, which hashes no shipped document and holds a pinned copy
  of `entity-runtime`'s), `jsonschema` in `schema-contract` and as a dev-dependency of
  `ess-gen` and `aep-schema`, `regex` in `trace-domain` (below), and `proptest` in `aep-domain` and
  as a dev-dependency of
  `ess-compiler` (`default-features = false`, and every property runs under a fixed seed so the gate
  cannot be flaky — the seed and the way to widen locally are documented where each is used).
  `entity-sqlite` brings **`rusqlite` with the `bundled` feature — SQLite compiled from
  vendored C** — the one C build in the workspace. Considered and refused: linking the host's
  SQLite (two machines could then disagree about one store), a pure-Rust database (none is the
  transactional store next door that is already tested against a torn write), and a second
  hand-written transactional store here (`crates/aep-backend-sqlite/src/lib.rs` § *Why
  `entity-sqlite`*). Reach for the workspace list before adding to it.
* **A non-workspace dependency carries its justification in the manifest**, beside the line that adds
  it: what it buys, which features are dropped and why that is safe here, and why the version matches
  the other crate that uses it. `crates/ess-gen/Cargo.toml` is the model.
* **`regex`, in `trace-domain`, is what makes `regex:` matchers work** — the sixteenth crate, taken
  on 2026-08-29 by `story:regex-matchers` after `TRACE-SPEC-008` had refused the matcher by name
  since the checker shipped. Two facts decided it and both are measurable:
  * **It was already here.** `cargo tree -i regex` reaches `protocol-cli` through `jsonschema`,
    which `schema-contract` takes at **run time** (`crates/schema-contract/Cargo.toml:18`), so the
    shipped binary has linked `regex` all along. Adopting it added **one line to `Cargo.lock`** —
    an edge, not a package — and no compile unit, no version and no audit surface.
  * **The refusal had stopped being free.** Its price was alternation, and a committed
    specification wants it: `conformance/trace/expectations.denial-step.trace.yaml:135` gates on
    *no shell call chained a second command onto a permitted one* and can only spell that
    `contains: "&& sed"`, which `; sed` and `&& rm` walk straight past.
  Considered and refused: **`fancy-regex`**, which backtracks — `glob_matches` was hand-written to
  be linear precisely because a checker reads whatever a transcript happens to contain, and an
  engine that can blow up on its input gives that away; a **hand-rolled engine**, which is a
  dependency written by us with none of the auditing and all of the surface; and **keeping the
  refusal**, which the row above prices. Default features stay on, and cutting them would be a
  claim the build does not honour: cargo unions features across a graph and `jsonschema` already
  builds this `regex` with its defaults. The decision is in the gap register as **D-8**.
* **Prefer no dependency, and record the refusal.** `crates/aep-domain/tests/invariants.rs` opens by
  weighing three mechanisms and taking the one that needs no new crate, saying what `trybuild` would
  have cost; `crates/ess-compiler/tests/billing.rs` scans its own sources on the same reasoning. Where
  a crate is taken, its surface is cut to what is used — `jsonschema` runs with
  `default-features = false`, which drops `resolve-http`, `resolve-file` and the TLS backend.
* **Nothing in `task check` reaches the network**, with one exception opted into by name:
  `postgres-check` talks to the server `ENTITY_POSTGRES_URL` names and to nothing when it is
  unset, and prints which. No other step downloads a schema, resolves a remote `$ref` or calls an
  API — `jsonschema` is built with `default-features = false` for exactly that reason. The Go steps hold the same line by construction: the generated module has no
  dependencies, and every `go` invocation runs with `GOPROXY=off` and `GOTOOLCHAIN=local`, so
  neither a dependency nor a `go` directive can make the toolchain fetch anything. The browser
  target holds it the same way, and it is the reason that target has **no `wasm-bindgen`**: that
  crate needs a cargo-installed CLI pinned to its own version, and the emitted tree would then
  resolve third-party crates inside a gate step. It emits its own JSON reader, writer and base64
  codec instead — about seven hundred fixed lines, the same bytes for every specification — and its
  manifest carries nothing but path dependencies into the Rust target's tree, which a test asserts.
  Keep it that way: a gate that needs the network is a gate that goes red for reasons that have
  nothing to do with the change.

## Changelog

`CHANGELOG.md` is maintained with the work, not reconstructed before a release. Every change that
alters what a *user of the protocol* sees — a new document type, a changed fact spelling, a rule that
now refuses something it used to allow — gets a line under `## [Unreleased]` in the same commit that
makes the change. Internal refactors that change nothing observable do not.

Write the entry for the person hitting the behaviour, not for the person who wrote it: "an approval
of version 3 no longer satisfies a review requirement for version 7", not "added freshness check".

## Watching and scoring a driven run

Two tools, both in `scripts/`, both written while driving `W4-3` and both fixed by being wrong in
front of the operator.

```console
scripts/drive-watch                 # follow the live run, whichever worktree it is in
scripts/drive-score <run> [<run>]   # what it spent, and how much of it was refused
```

**`drive-watch` searches every worktree of this repository**, because a driven run happens in
whichever checkout the driver was pointed at and there are usually several. Run from the wrong one
it used to follow a run finished a week earlier and print nothing, which reads exactly like a live
run that has stopped; it now says so, with the age, and names what to type instead. It follows
whichever transcript is being written and switches state by itself.

**`drive-score` prints cost and turns beside waste, always.** *Waste* is the share of tool calls
somebody refused — the policy, the harness, or the CLI — and it is the number a change to the driver
moves. Reporting it alone is how an instrument comes to agree with whoever built it: admitting
`grep` to a reading state took waste from 17.2% to 3.0% and multiplied one state's cost by 3.6, and
a scorer that showed only the first half would have called that an unqualified win. A command that
ran and reported a failure is **not** waste — a red suite is the point of running it. The line is
whether the program refused the invocation or answered it.

## Being the subject of a live harness evaluation

metaharness' `evals/aep/run-driven.sh` drives this repository under either
harness and scores the transcripts; **that script is where the procedure and its traps are written
down**, and it is the file to read first. What follows is only what this repository has to get
right to be a fair subject.

**A confined run cannot see this filesystem.** The sandbox binds `/usr`, `/bin`, `/lib`, `/lib64`
and the workspace, and nothing else. Two consequences that each cost a paid run:

- `driven_programs` must **not** declare the CLI. An allow-list decides what a `run` may *name*;
  only a mount decides what the sandbox *contains*. The bare name failed on `PATH`, the absolute
  host path was then admitted and still found nothing, and both times the session gave up on the
  CLI and hand-wrote the planning store. The driver travels as `--driver` instead, which stages the
  binary read-only and allow-lists its mounted path; steps quote `DRIVEN_DRIVER`
  (`/toolchain/driver/protocol`) and are told the bare name does not resolve.
- Read-only is not incidental: this is the binary that records the run's evidence, and a run able
  to rewrite it has no evidence.

**The store rule reaches the native arm as a program, not as a seam.** `protocol drive` adjudicates
every call itself for a vendor harness; the native loop has no such seam and consults hook programs
instead, so the driver writes a `hooks.json` per step pointing at `protocol drive hook`. Without it
that arm runs with the content tier off while its column reads as though it were on.

**The planning skill is not handed over as `context:` any more.** Both harnesses read the plugin at
`integrations/claude-code`, so a description is in the standing instruction and the body is one
`skill` call away. A `context:` key reappearing under an `llm` step is the map regressing to eager
delivery — billed on every turn of a stateless loop — and `flow.rs` asserts its absence.

**Do not run `cargo fmt --all` in this repository.** It reformats `generated/` and `synth-check`
then fails the gate on fourteen workspaces. Use `cargo fmt -p <crate>`. If it has already happened,
`cargo xtask synth` regenerates from the specifications and restores them — do not `git checkout`
them, and do not hand-edit.

**Read the gate's own count, and distrust a remembered one.** `task check` at `2b5be62` gives
`191 suites, 2830 passed, exit 0`. A figure quoted from memory was wrong twice in one day; if a
number matters, measure the tree with and without the change rather than comparing against
something recalled.

## Releases

The bare-version tag is an org-wide convention (atlas § *Naming*); what follows is this
repository's procedure around it.

Each delivered wave gets an annotated tag whose name is the version and **nothing else** —
`0.12.0`, not `0.12.0-scope-and-the-fourth-arm`. A slug in a tag name is a second copy of what the
tag message and the changelog heading already say, and it is the copy that has to be retyped
correctly in every `git checkout`, comparison URL and release note. Tags before `0.12.0` carry the
older slugged form and are left as they are; nothing new gets one.

The tag points at the commit that delivered the work, not at the changelog housekeeping that
follows it. Its `CHANGELOG.md` heading matches the version. The tag message states what the wave delivered and the
implementation percentage after it, so `git tag -n99` reads as a project history without opening a
browser.

**The workspace version moves with the tag, and `version-check` fails when it does not.**
`protocol --version` prints `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`; while that number lags the tags, every build of the
tool reports the same string for ever and a stale install cannot be told from the current one — which
is exactly how a binary predating the store journal wrote no journal entries for a day while printing
the same version the current build printed.

**Bumping it no longer regenerates the tree.** A generated artifact records what it was made
*from* — its two digests — and never which build made it (`story:generator-version-stamp`), so a
version bump changes no projection, no suite, no synthesised tree and no cluster IR.
`a_version_bump_rewrites_no_generated_file` in `xtask` holds that: it regenerates the whole corpus
and fails if any file spells the build version.

**Two files still move, and for a reason that is content.** The conformance evidence documents name
the implementation they checked — `billing-reference 0.32.1` — which is what the record is *about*,
not a stamp of the thing that wrote it. Rewrite both before cutting the tag:

**The tag has to exist before the delivered-waves row can be written, so cutting one is a loop:**

```console
git commit …                       # the work
git tag -a 0.27.3 -m "…"           # so `cargo xtask status` can see the row it must write
cargo xtask status                 # writes the row into docs/status.md
git commit -m "chore(release): 0.27.3" docs/status.md
git tag -f -a 0.27.3 -m "…"        # onto the commit that carries the record
task check                         # the whole gate, at the tag
the private Atlas delivery procedure push origin main 0.27.3
```

**Every tag lookup in the gate is scoped to tags reachable from `HEAD`.** A gate step runs at a
commit, but `git tag` answers with the tags the *clone* holds. Two tags in one `git push` used to
mean the older tag's Release run saw the newer one and failed a release that had been correct when
it was cut — which is how `0.27.1` shipped with no GitHub Release. Reachability makes each gate
answer *what had shipped as of this commit*; batching tags in one push is safe again.

## Commits

* Conventional prefixes: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`.
* Title, blank line, then a body explaining what changed and why. No title-only commits.
* Ticket references go in a `Refs:` tagline at the end of the body, never in the title.
* Write messages through a file or a quoted heredoc (`git commit -F -` with `<<'MSG'`), never
  `-m "…"` with backticks in the text.

## Branches and waves

Written down 2026-08-30. Until then this convention existed only in `git log`, so every wave
rediscovered it and no reader of the repository could find it.

* **`impl/<story-slug>` for one unit of work, `wave/<name>` for the branch several land on,
  `run/<name>` for a driver run that is not a unit of work.** The slug is the story id's name part,
  unchanged — a branch a reader cannot join back to a story is one nobody can audit.
* **Every `impl/*` in a wave forks from the same base**, and they merge back serially. That is what
  makes one gate run at the end mean anything: the merged result is the only tree that has ever
  held all of them at once, and it is the tree that gets gated.
* **A merge subject names the branch, then what the work did** — `Merge impl/blocker-relation: a
  blocker is typed by what would clear it, and a parked item stops looking like a moving one`. Not
  the branch name twice.
* **A wave is bracketed by two `chore(store):` commits.** The first carries the selection and its
  reasoning — the pool, the properties it was chosen on, one line per story naming the objective it
  serves. It is the only durable record of *why these and not others*. The last carries the gate
  run that closed them, the commit the evidence was recorded against, and anything found on the way
  that was filed rather than fixed.
* **One gate run closes the whole wave.** Each story's `test_result` names the merge commit, which
  contains the other units too. That is correct — it is the tree that was actually gated — and a
  per-unit run would be evidence about a tree nobody shipped.
* **A merge of `main` into a live wave branch, or a rebase of a unit onto a new base, is said in
  the subject with the sha.** Either is fine; leaving it unsaid is not.

The plugin's `wave` skill follows these, and
`integrations/claude-code/skills/wave/references/branch-and-merge.md` is the long form.

## Driving a run: standing rules for whoever is at the wheel

Written 2026-08-29, after a night of driving this repository with itself. Each line is a mistake
that was made, not a principle that sounded good.

**Every process you start is yours until you have watched it die.** `kill $VAR` where `VAR` came
from `jobs -p` in a non-interactive shell kills nothing: there are no jobs, `kill` gets no argument,
and when that shell exits its children are reparented to init and run forever. Twelve busy-loop
spinners started that way held four cores at 99% for thirty-four minutes on 2026-08-29 and were
found by the operator, not by the agent that started them — which had already printed "hogs killed"
on the strength of an `echo`. Start long-lived things under `systemd-run --user --scope --slice=…`
so `systemctl --user stop` takes the whole tree, or wrap them in `timeout`; then **verify with
`kill -0` or `ps` that they are gone** and report the check, not the intent.

**A wait condition must not match the waiter.** `until ! pgrep -f "protocol drive run"; do sleep
20; done` never exits: the waiting shell's own command line contains that string, so `pgrep` finds
itself and the loop spins until something kills it. Four such monitors were left running on
2026-08-29, in a session that had already written the rule above, and the work each was waiting for
had finished before the first one was started. Match on something the waiter cannot contain — a pid
from `$!`, a marker file the job touches on exit — or use the harness's own completion notification
and do not poll at all. Then check the exit is real: `ps` for the job, not `echo` for yourself.

**Load is not a proof, and it is the expensive way to be wrong.** The failing-under-load hypothesis
about a flaky test was "attacked" by spawning CPU hogs and re-running twenty times, which
demonstrated nothing either way and cost half an hour of the machine. The property was
timing-dependent, so the proof was to *change the timing*: slow the fixture's writer 25x and the
same failure becomes deterministic in 50 ms on an idle machine, with a mutation that turns it red
every run. When something is intermittent, find the parameter it depends on and move it. Reach for
brute force only when there is no such parameter, and say so.

**Kill a run the moment you know it cannot succeed.** Not after the next state, not after the report
— the moment. A run whose session is hunting for a tool that will never be published, or whose task
document is the wrong one, is spending real money to produce a record nobody wants. Diagnosing it
and letting it continue is the worst of both.

**Test the constraint you already suspect, first.** On 2026-08-29 the native arm was written off
after two hours of plumbing — endpoint paths, cgroup delegation, program allowlists, sandbox `PATH`
— by a `400 Bad Request: maximum context length is 32768 tokens`. That the model's window might not
hold the task had been written down *before the first fix*, and never measured. One request sizing
the smallest state's prompt against the window would have ended it in a minute. A suspicion you do
not test is a suspicion you will confirm expensively.

**Prove the environment before the model.** Every launch-time fact is decidable for free: the
binaries on the constructed `PATH`, the endpoint, the workspace, the allowlist. Run the pre-flight
with `--max-iterations 0` first, every time. Four of the eight defects found tonight were launch
environment, and each was found *after* a paid session rather than before a free one.

**There are always two `PATH`s.** The driver's own, and the constructed one metaharness gives the
child (`$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin`). A binary on one is not on the other, and
`cargo install` defaults to `$CARGO_HOME/bin`, which is on neither. Say which one a refusal means.

**A refusal that names an install command must name one that works.** Twice tonight a message told
an operator to install where the thing doing the resolving would not look.

**Measure what you set out to move, and the thing that pays for it.** Waste fell from 17.2% to 2.7%
and one state's cost tripled; a scorer that reported only the first would have called that a win.
And a metric that counts refusals cannot see 30 successful calls that achieved nothing.

**Write the finding into the store, not into the chat.** A defect explained in a message is gone
when the session ends. `protocol artifact new story …` costs a minute.

**When an instrument disagrees with a run, suspect the instrument.** The tool audit was wrong about
a harness twice before it was right about one, and both times it was loud. An audit that fires on a
session holding exactly what it needs teaches the reader to skip the next true one.
