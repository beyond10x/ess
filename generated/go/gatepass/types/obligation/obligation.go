// Package obligation carries the typed refusal of an unmet obligation.
//
// An obligation is a capability the synthesis plan owes the implementor — the contract is
// declared, the behaviour is not. Until an implementation satisfies one, its stub returns
// [UnmetObligation]: a value naming the plan entry, never a panic and never a guess, so a
// module built on stubs compiles and reports its own gaps.
//
// Its own package, and one that imports nothing from this module: Go refuses an import
// cycle where Rust allows a module cycle, and every bounded context's package has to name
// this type.
