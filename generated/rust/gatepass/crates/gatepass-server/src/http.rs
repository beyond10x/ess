//! HTTP/1.1, as much of it as a synthesised surface needs and no more.
//!
//! Not a framework and not a deployment. One connection at a time, in accept order: read the
//! request line, read the headers, read exactly `Content-Length` bytes, answer, close. There is no
//! keep-alive, no pipelining, no compression, no TLS and no thread pool, and every one of those is
//! a decision a deployment gets to make rather than one a generator makes for it. What this file
//! *does* guarantee is the part the specification determines: the status codes and the bodies.
//!
//! Written here rather than taken from a crate for the reason the JSON reader beside it is: the
//! emitted tree builds with zero third-party crates, inside a gate that reaches no network.
