# Review boundaries wave 2 — 2026-09-05

**Approved and opening.** This wave fixes untrusted kubectl failure diagnostics and output path containment. Both stories serve `vision:O2`.

Skill version 0.7.0. Coordinator: `wave/review-boundaries-2`, managed record `wt-752828a285ba`. Published base: `0f80f71e7ef997e8a3c7d2ad19e9997090e8e769`.

## Authority and selection

The user granted all implementation waves, then explicitly approved publishing this and subsequent green remediation waves and requested cleanup. The actual grants are `approval-record:review-remediation-standing-implementation` and `approval-record:review-remediation-standing-publication`. This is an interactive session with standing authorization; no bypass is inferred.

Authorized commits: opening scope/approval/page commit, two unit implementations and their adversarial tests, serial integration merges, closing store/evidence commit, merge to main, publication of the green wave and cleanup records. Releases and tags require a separate grant.

The store was read afresh after wave 1; both selected stories have no dependencies or blockers. Independent scope is high-confidence and cited. Full store computation and exact selected-set computation follow verbatim below. The selected set has no collision, unassessed story or cycle.

Prioritize the newly reproduced credential diagnostic disclosure and the original P0 output escape. Semantic diff is left for a binding compatibility decision about persisted vocabulary and dependency-closed digests. Persisted delivery and InfraIr validation compete for the CLI surface; further conformance work needs its migration design. Remaining ready stories are deferred to keep N=2 and shorten integration feedback. No review item is silently closed by selection.

Native `aep-drive:story-scoper`, `aep-drive:implementor` and `aep-drive:adversary` types are not exposed by this harness. Collaboration agents read their exact plugin charters; inherited model, no override. This adapter deviation is explicit.

## Preflight and prior cleanup

ESS primary is clean on main, now published at the base. After fresh GC marked both records eligible, exact-id managed GC removed `review-secret-sanitization` and `review-report-reader-validation`, with recovery proof through advertised origin main. Their unit branches were deleted with git branch -d. git worktree list and filesystem existence checks confirm both gone; no impl/* branch remains. Their scratch was archived before the previous cargo clean. Unrelated ESS trees remain untouched. The reusable coordinator has its own target (1,863,996 KiB) and website node_modules (661,116 KiB).

Free space before selection: 115,393,671,168 bytes. Revised hard reserve remains 8,589,934,592 bytes. Prior measured unit targets were 171 MiB and 313 MiB; the complete reused integration target is about 1.8 GiB. N=2 is a conservative coordinator estimate at this capacity; remeasure at dispatch and return. Each tree builds in its own target, with /usr/bin/sccache, CARGO_INCREMENTAL=0 and dev/test debug=0. Numeric model budget was already requested and not supplied; N=2 is within the default and four-slot harness limit.

Atlas authority is clean at remote main `6035d6e1209686ca474a3f43975fde7d8621ba48` in the current managed authority tree. All commits/pushes use its bot wrapper and identity verification.

## Unit records

Absolute root: `/home/timo/.local/state/worktree/trees/b10x/ess`. Worktrees below are created from the opening commit; build and scratch paths are relative to each unit tree. No shared target directory.

| Story | Branch | Worktree under root | Build | Scratch | Head/stage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| review-kubectl-diagnostic-sanitization | impl/review-kubectl-diagnostic-sanitization | review-kubectl-diagnostic-sanitization | target/ | target/review-boundaries-2/ | pending opening commit and provisioning |
| review-output-containment | impl/review-output-containment | review-output-containment | target/ | target/review-boundaries-2/ | pending opening commit and provisioning |

File-backed briefs will bind exact opening SHA, assignments, package gates and scope confirmation. Coordinator owns AEP, source staging, bot commits, integration, gates, publication and managed cleanup. Each green implementation goes to a tests-only adversary. Max two full attack passes; routing preserves original reports verbatim. Each offline gate step reports its own exit code and runner output; applicable site build follows. No terminal move before those results.
